# COVID19_warning

This robot was created to find people walking around without wearing masks and to broadcast warnings to wear masks.

I use jetson nano for detecting and raspberry pi for slam. Also, i use openCR for dinamixel and use arduino for broadcast.
but mabye you can make this just using jetson nano and openCR.

Tips.
  - you should make larger memory in jetson nano to build opencv more successfully.
  - you can make easier if you use turtlebot3 kit made by Robotiz.
